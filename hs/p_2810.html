<h2 style="text-align: center;">Write and publish a Kindle eBook</h2>
<hr/>
<p>If students are good at anything, it is research and writing. With the help of the Amazon Kindle store, anyone can publish e-books and make money.</p>
<p>The Kindle app can now be used on almost any device (laptop, iPad, smartphone, and of course Kindle), so your global market is huge!</p>
<p>List your book, the price is £1.49-£6.99, you will get 70% of the sale. Considering that Amazon is the ultimate sales machine (remember that people are spending money), this is really an amazing deal.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The key to the success of e-books is to create value and write non-fiction works. Just bundle together the information about common problems you have researched and sorted out (such as "Secrets to Finding a Job") and present it in an easy-to-understand format (e-book) to prove that someone has spent some money on it.</p>
<p>Another important tip is to design a beautiful cover (make them browse) so that it stands out. Once your book is on the Kindle store, it's really important to get some reviews so that its results can be higher. Encourage readers to leave honest comments at the end of the book.</p>
<p>The best thing about this lucrative idea is that once you spend time (say 20 hours), you will earn passive income in the next few years! For a step-by-step guide to publishing and making money using e-books, see "How to write a non-fiction e-book in 21 days."</p>
