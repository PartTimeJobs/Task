<h2 style="text-align: center;">Buy and sell domain names</h2>
<hr/>
<p>A domain name is just a website address (such as "savethestudent.org" or "mysite.co.uk") and has many extensions (.com, .net, .co.uk, etc.).</p>
<p>Registered on GoDaddy.com, their price is only 0.99 US dollars, and the price of high-quality domain names can even reach millions of dollars when they are sold. In 2007, the sales price of VacationRentals.com was as high as 35 million US dollars!</p>
<p>You may not encounter similar problems now, but you can still make quick profits with a little search. The trick is to find an available domain name with certain commercial value, make a snap purchase, and then list the domain name for sale on websites such as Sedo.com.</p>
