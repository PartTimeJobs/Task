<hr/>
<p>Interested in generating passive income? You need a website. This is how you make money while you sleep.</p>
<p>It takes less than 20 minutes to start a website with Bluehost, hardly costs any money, and can be completed by an 82-year-old. It only takes a little bit of social media insertion to attract your first visitors, and there are many ways to monetize your website.</p>
<p>"Save the Students" is just one example of a successful website, which was founded by Owen Burek in the first year of university and has since developed into a full-time large-scale enterprise.</p>
<p>Read Owen's step-by-step guide to learn how to launch a website in 20 minutes. This is indeed one of the best assets you can have.</p>
