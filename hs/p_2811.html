<h2 style="text-align: center;">Affiliate marketing</h2>
<hr/>
<p>If you have a good reputation on social media, or even a blog or website, you can start making money right away by promoting various companies, products, services, and offers online.</p>
<p>Register as a publisher on the Awin network, check its discount blog or browse the list of businesses to find things you think your friends will be interested in, get your affiliate link and share it. If someone uses your link to make a purchase (within a maximum of 90 days), you will receive a considerable commission.</p>
<p>To go further, create a website (please read our guide) or a popular Facebook page, and invite all your friends to join the website and post your membership offers on it.</p>
