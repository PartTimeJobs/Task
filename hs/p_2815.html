<h2 style="text-align: center;">Source property for wealthy investors</h2>
<hr/>
<p>We all know how much money there is in property, but on the surface (with house prices as high as they are) you might be thinking this market is off-limits.</p>
<p>Truth is, lots of people make a great deal of cash simply sourcing suitable properties for wealthy investors who simply have no time.</p>
<p>The trick is to find properties below market value (BMV) by avoiding estate agents and instead flyering your area with your contact details offering to buy houses. Then approach investors with a no-brainer offer to pass on the details of cut-price property in exchange for a % of the sale value.</p>
<p>Most cities will have monthly networking events for landlords and property investors. Track these down, sign up, put on your best suit and go along with lots of business cards. Or you could start on LinkedIn or even Twitter to build some initial contacts.</p>
<p>As you might imagine, this isn't necessarily a quick way to make money but once you've got a few investors in your phone book it can prove to be very lucrative in the long run.</p>
<p>If you're interested, I recommend reading this book.</p>
