<p>Is there a bicycle, a motorcycle or a car? What about smart phones? As long as you have free time, you can earn extra money by providing food or personnel.</p>
<p>Subscribe to express delivery companies like Deliveroo, who are always looking for new riders. They allow you to work with complete flexibility when needed, transporting food from restaurants to customers’ homes. You can earn up to £16 per hour.</p>
<p>Contact local takeaways and large chain stores (such as Dominos) directly to see if they have a delivery job, thus doubling your chances.</p>
